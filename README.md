# Java-DSA

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Java solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and by topic (Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.). Itâ€™s designed for students, interview prep, and anyone who wants readable, idiomatic Java implementations with clear explanations and dry runs.

## Goals

- Provide correct, efficient Java solutions for LeetCode problems.

- Keep each solution compact, easy to read, and non-AI-styled (human-friendly).

- Include time & space complexity, approach notes, and a short dry-run for each solution.

- Help users learn patterns and reuse common templates for interviews.
